Title:

NeuroVertebra: A Self-Calibrating, Biocompatible Spinal Interface for Functional Nerve Realignment

Author: ApingROC 

Abstract:
This paper proposes a novel neural interface system, dubbed the “NeuroVertebra,” designed to restore signal continuity across severed spinal cord segments. The system integrates a biocompatible titanium vertebral scaffold with a gold/DLC-based electrode matrix interface that enables spatially-coherent realignment of severed nerve ends. Unlike conventional nerve repair methods, which lack precise indexing between nerve ends, NeuroVertebra employs a CCD-style electrode array that senses extracellular electrical charge and uses real-time signal correlation to virtually rotate and align the contact matrix, restoring functional topography. The design is open-source and proposed for development under the Apache 2.0 license.



1. Introduction
Spinal cord injuries often result in irreversible loss of function due to the failure of severed axons to reconnect. Even with clean transections, no practical method exists to realign nerve bundles with their original topography. The NeuroVertebra aims to bridge this gap through a charge-sensing electrode array and a self-calibrating interface logic capable of restoring signal integrity without the need for full biological regeneration.

2. Design Overview
The NeuroVertebra system is composed of three main elements:
1. Titanium Vertebral Frame: A 3D-printed, porous titanium scaffold replaces the damaged vertebral body, providing mechanical stability and hosting the interface components.
2. Gold/DLC Matrix Interface: A CCD-style array of recessed gold contacts embedded in a diamond-like carbon (DLC) matrix. Each gold electrode is slightly recessed and features a central needle tip, designed to make precise, low-impedance contact with nerve tissue under slight pressure. This ensures activation only upon direct tissue engagement, reducing noise and increasing contact fidelity.
3. Rotational Signal Alignment Logic: A charge-sensing chip reads extracellular potentials and rotates the distal matrix virtually until signal correlation with the proximal matrix reaches maximum fidelity. This ensures accurate nerve-to-nerve mapping without physical guidance cues.

3. Biological Integration
• Biocompatibility: All materials (titanium, gold, DLC) are well-established in implantable devices.
• CSF Compatibility: The interface allows cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to flow naturally, maintaining the chemical environment necessary for neuronal health.
• No Foreign Body Reaction: Recessed electrodes with needle tips and DLC reduce glial scarring and inflammation.

4. Technical Implementation
• Charge-Sensing Matrix: Based on CMOS/MEA tech, capable of reading and stimulating individual axons or fascicle-level bundles.
• Pressure-Activated Contacts: Gold electrodes are activated by tissue contact and slight compression, with central needle tips ensuring minimal resistance and maximal specificity.
• Bidirectional Electrode Function: Each electrode site is designed for dual-mode operation—utilizing fast electronic switching and signal separation circuits, the same CCD-style contact can both record extracellular potentials (read mode) and deliver stimulation pulses (write mode). Advanced signal filtering ensures that recording is not affected by stimulus artifacts, allowing real-time interaction with neural activity.
• Virtual Alignment Algorithm: Correlation-based software rotates or digitally shifts the electrode mapping grid until optimal signal matching is achieved. This is the key mechanism for restoring correct spatial alignment across the injury site.

5. Use Cases and Applications
• Restoration of motor/sensory function in clean spinal transections
• Integration into modular neural prosthetics
• Potential applications in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) and neurorehabilitation devices

6. Open Source and Future Work
The NeuroVertebra is intended as an open-source, community-driven project released under the Apache 2.0 license. Contributions from engineers, neuroscientists, and biohackers are encouraged to develop prototypes, refine signal mapping algorithms, and explore miniaturization strategies.

7. Conclusion
The NeuroVertebra interface offers a feasible, biocompatible, and technically realizable approach to spinal cord signal restoration. By leveraging existing microfabrication, sensing, and implantable tech, it bridges biological and digital domains without requiring full axonal regrowth. This paradigm could redefine how we approach spinal injuries and neuromodulation.
